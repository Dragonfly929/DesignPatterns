# Topic: *Structural Design Patterns*
### Course: TMPS
### Author: Maia Zaica

## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Structural Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about the functionalities that your system will need to provide to the user.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Implement some additional functionalities, or create a new project using structural design patterns.__

## Theoretical background:
&ensp; &ensp; Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures and systems. They provide a way to organize objects and classes in a way that is both flexible and efficient, while allowing for the reuse and modification of existing code. Structural design patterns address common problems encountered in the composition of classes and objects, such as how to create new objects that inherit functionality from existing objects, how to create objects that share functionality without duplicating code, or how to define relationships between objects in a flexible and extensible way.

&ensp; &ensp; Some examples of from this category of design patterns are:

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy

## Main tasks:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. By creating a new project, or extending your last one (Lab work Nr2), implement at least 2 structural design patterns in your project:__
* The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system.
* The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client.
* There should only be one client for the whole system.

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities (an example project structure):__
* client
* domain
    * factories
    * builder
    * models
* utilities
* data(if applies)

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):__
* Topic of the laboratory work
* Author
* Introduction/Theory/Motivation
* Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well)
    * Indicate the location of the code snippet
    * Emphasize the main idea and motivate the usage of the pattern
* Results/Screenshots/Conclusions
