## Objectives
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about what communication between software entities might be involed in your system.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Create a new Project or add some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns.__

## Theoretical background
&ensp; &ensp; Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the interaction and communication between objects and classes. They provide a way to organize the behavior of objects in a way that is both flexible and reusable, while separating the responsibilities of objects from the specific implementation details. Behavioral design patterns address common problems encountered in object behavior, such as how to define interactions between objects, how to control the flow of messages between objects, or how to define algorithms and policies that can be reused across different objects and classes.

&ensp; &ensp; Some examples from this category of design patterns are :

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Observer
* Strategy
